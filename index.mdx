<!--

My name is Varya. I work as an independent consultant, and design systems are my
major focus. I started with libraries of components about 10 years ago,
before the term "design systems" even emerged.

By that time, my own understanding and the community's was more technical.
We were paying a lot of attention to how to code the components,
how to document them.

Slightly by today, I changed my focus to more process and people oriented.
I realised that the biggest obstacle on the way is the gap between specialists:
designers and developers, product people and business people. In the meanwhile
I got a design education that helped me to see the picture at scale.

Nowadays, even though I am still doing a lot of hands-on and architectural frontend
work related to the design systems, I shift to engineering&project management, educating,
and enganging people.

## Large-Scale Project Challenges
{ .block-list .title-08 }

- ### Complex Codebases<br/>
  Navigating intricate structures and dependencies in extensive projects.
- ### Large dynamic teams<br/>
  Coordinating work and maintaining consistency across diverse coding styles.
- ### Evolving Requirements<br/>
  Adapting to changing project needs while preserving code integrity.
- ### Maintenance Difficulties<br/>
  Keeping large codebases organized, efficient, and bug-free over time.

<!--
TODO: text
What is the focus of this lecture and how it is related to me as a professional.

v2, s3:
CSS and JavaScript Challenges in Large- Scale Projects
Large-scale web projects present unique challenges that can overwhelm even experienced developers. These projects often involve complex codebases, multiple developers working simultaneously, and constantly evolving requirements. As the project grows, maintaining consistency and managing updates becomes increasingly difficult, leading to a host of CSS and JavaScript-related issues.
Complex Codebases
Navigating and understanding extensive code structures becomes challenging as projects scale.
Multiple Developers
Coordinating efforts and maintaining consistency across a team of developers can lead to conflicts and inconsistencies.
Evolving Requirements
Adapting to changing project needs while maintaining code integrity becomes increasingly difficult over time.
Maintenance Difficulties
As projects grow, updating and maintaining code becomes more time-consuming and error-prone.

## Where is CSS hard?
{ .slide--shout .slide--highlighted }

<!--

## Building meme
{ .no-title .slide--full-image }

![](pictures/css-building.jpg)

<!--
-->


## Is this good?

```css
H1 { color: blue }
P EM { font-weight: bold }
A:link IMG { border: 2px solid blue }
A:visited IMG { border: 2px solid red }
A:active IMG { border: 2px solid lime }
```

<!--
Now look at this code. Do you see something strange? Any guess?
Who would write their CSS like this?

The problem is that CSS was created to make text bold and links underlined. It ideally suited
solving these problems. In many websites developers still use CSS like.

Actually this code from [CSS level 1 specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1/). It is
very simple, was recommended in 1996. Time passed and we met new chalenges.
-->


## What makes CSS hard?

<ul>
  <li>Vertical centering</li>
  <li>Equal height columns</li>
  <li>Browser inconsistencies</li>
  <li className="next">Unobvious tricks</li>
</ul>

<!--
Before we decide what is wrong with that peice, let's guess what is hard in CSS.

When ppl are asked, the repson is usually
- vertical centing
- making columns of equial height
- browers render CSS differently, so it takes special knowledge and work to make the interface consistent
- many solutions are unobvious tricks which needed to be memorized

But this is not true, this is easy or at least clear how to manage. You can google for all this questions.
-->


## What <mark>really</mark> makes CSS hard?

* Scoping
* Specificity conflicts
* Non-deterministic matches
* Dependency management
* Removing unused code

<!--
The real hard problems of CSS are here:
- No scoping. Everything is CSS is global.
- Specificity conflicts. I'll explain in detal later.
- Non-deterministic matches which naturally result from declarativeness of CSS language
- Dependency management
- Removing unused code
-->


## CSS has no scoping

```css
a { /* Affects all the links */
  color: red;
}
ul li a { /* Affects all the links in lists */
  color: green;
}
```

<!--
This especially maters if you link third-party CSS.
A common problem for developing libraries or code which will be later delivered to another web site.
Everything in CSS is global, and writing good CSS is similar to writing a good program module if you only allowed to use
global variables.
This can be mixed with another CSS and applied to wrong nodes.
Writing good CSS means you has to predict the future.
-->


## Specificity

> Specificity is the means by which a browser decides which property values are the most relevant to an element and gets
> to be applied. Specificity is only based on the matching rules which are composed of selectors of different sorts.

<!--
Another problem is specificity.
Who remember what specificity is?
Ok, I will explain.
-->


## The most specific matters

```html
<div id="test">
  <span>Text</span>
</div>
```

```css
div#test span { color: green }
span { color: red }
div span { color: blue }
```

<!--
If a brower has 2, 3 or more rules which match the same DOM node, how it decides what are the properties to take into
work?
The order does not matter.
For every selector a browser calculates how important this set of rules is. The rule with the more specific selector
would be prioritized.
So, here we see...
-->


## How to overwrite?

```
<div class="sidebar">Left floated sidebar</div>
```

<div className="next">

```
.sidebar { /* Does it redefine `div.sidebar`?! */
  float: right;
}
```

</div>

<div className="next">

```
body .sidebar { /* Overwrites 'div.sidebar {}' */
  float: right;
}
```

</div>

<!--
When it comes to developments, specificity matters when redefining pre-given
components.

To redefine the left-floated sidebar, we would overwrite the rule.
-->


## Specificity hell
{: .no-title }

```css
.navbar-inverse .navbar-nav>li>a {
  color: #999;
}

#home-menu-container #home-menu li a {
  color: red;
}

body #home-menu ul li a {
  color: blue !important;
}
```
{: .code--size--m }

<!--
People ask on Stackoverflow how to overwrite Bootsrtap
These things can be in different files
-->


## Family guy meme
{ .no-title .slide--full-image }

![](pictures/blinds-meme.gif)


## Non-deterministic matches

```css
#content div div {
  float: left;
}
```

<!-- This can be matched to anything -->
<!-- You cannot rely on the document structure, because it contantly changes while developing -->
<!-- в момент, когда ты пишешь, ты указываешь признаки нод, на которые сматчится правило, а не точный адрес. смотри:
можно писать адрес «Rettigweg 1, 13187 Berlin", а можно «около Wollankstrasse такая боковая улица с тремя домами, и
там есть такой желтый дом, и там на втором этаже ещё балконы металлические с узорами» -->

## Doctor meme
{ .no-title .slide--full-image }

![](pictures/doctor-meme.gif)

<!--
-->


## Dependency management
{ .dependency-management }

### No dependencies, sorry

<div className="next">

<h3>But what about?</h3>

```
@import url('i-need-this.css');
```

</div>

### No, sorry again.
{ .next .sorry }

<style>{`
.dependency-management h3 {
  padding-top: 1em;
  margin-bottom: 0.5em;
}
.dependency-management .sorry
{
  color: green;
}
`}</style>

<!--
CSS was not developed as a programming language and now it still isn't. So, there is no way to declare that
one piece of CSS needs anotehr one.
OK, there is import. But this is not  aproduction solution. And assuming undeterministic matches we cannot rely on it.
-->


## Removing unused code

100 pages in projects

```css
.person div a {
  color: pink;
}
```

Can I remove it? Will it break something? Maybe it is for a third-party HTML code?

<!--
CSS is declarative, so you cannot say what are the nodes the rules will aply to.
If you have a lot of pages you cannot remove a piece of CSS and check visually if something is broken.
Even worse with  dynamic web sites.
-->


## Where CSS is hard?
{: .no-title .hard-css }

<table><thead>

<th markdown="1">

This is not hard in CSS

## Where is JavaScript hard?
{ .slide--shout .slide--highlighted }

<!--
-->

## Old-School JavaScript Challenges
{ .numbered-list .title-08 }

- ### Direct DOM Manipulation
  Messy code with direct element selection and modification.
- ### Event Handling Complexity
  Difficult management of multiple event listeners and callbacks.
- ### State Management
  Lack of centralized state leading to inconsistent UI updates.
- ### Maintenance Problems
  Spaghetti code without clear structure, making updates risky.

<!--
-->

## Vanilla Js or Component Driven?
{ .no-title }


| Vanilla Js    | Component-Driven |
| -------- | ------- |
| Direct DOM manipulation, global functions, and scattered state management.  | Encapsulated logic, isolated state, and reusable UI building blocks.    |

### Structured components lead to cleaner, more maintainable code

<!--
TODO: Move or remove this slide
-->

## Maintenance Mayhem
{ .block-list }

- ### Code Comprehension
  Difficulty understanding complex, intertwined code over time.
- ### Risky Updates
  Fear of breaking unknown dependenciesч when making changes.
- ### Inconsistent Components
  Similar components diverge, leading to maintenance nightmares.
- ### Scalability Issues
  Growing projects become increasingly difficult to manage and expand.

## Component-Driven Development
{ .slide--shout .slide--primary }

<!--
-->


## Component-Driven Development
{ .numbered-list .title-08 }

- ### UI Breakdown
  Dividing interfaces into reusable, independent components.
- ### Encapsulation
  Bundling functionality and styling within self- contained units.
- ### Consistency
  Promoting uniform design and behavior across the application.
- ### Maintainability
  Easier updates and bug fixes with isolated component logic

<!--

## Benefits of Component-Driven Development
{ .title-06 .cover--top .table--naked .text-08 }

<Cover src="pictures/v1-13.jpg" alt=""/>

| Reusability | Easier Testing | Improved Collaboration | Faster Development |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Components can be easily reused across different parts of the application. | Isolated components allow for more straightforward and thorough testing. | Designers and developers can work more efficiently on specific components. | Reusable components speed up the development and iteration process. |
